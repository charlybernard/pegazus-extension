    "- **file_management**: Provides functions for managing files, including reading, writing, and manipulating file paths.  \n",
    "- **time_processing**: Handles time-based data, such as parsing timestamps, date normalization, and temporal computations.\n",

    "### Graph Construction Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **graphdb**: Handles interactions with the GraphDB database, including querying, updating, and managing named graphs.  \n",
    "- **attribute_version_comparisons**: Facilitates the comparison of different versions of attributes in RDF data.  \n",
    "- **multi_sources_processing**: Processes data from multiple sources, likely for aggregation, reconciliation, or cleaning.  \n",
    "- **factoids_creation**: Contains functions to generate factoids, which are small structured pieces of information extracted from sources.  \n",
    "- **resource_rooting**: Manages the rooting or linking of resources, possibly resolving references and establishing connections between entities.  \n",
    "- **evolution_construction**: Deals with constructing or evolving entities and data models over time, including temporal versioning.  \n",
    "- **fact_graph_construction**: Constructs the final knowledge graph by combining all processed data, factoids, and relationships.\n",
