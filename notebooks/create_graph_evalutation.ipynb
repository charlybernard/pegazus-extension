    "- **file_management**: Provides functions for managing files, including reading, writing, and manipulating file paths.  \n",
    "- **time_processing**: Handles time-based data, such as parsing timestamps, date normalization, and temporal computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Construction Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **graphdb**: Handles interactions with the GraphDB database, including querying, updating, and managing named graphs.  \n",
    "- **attribute_version_comparisons**: Facilitates the comparison of different versions of attributes in RDF data.  \n",
    "- **multi_sources_processing**: Processes data from multiple sources, likely for aggregation, reconciliation, or cleaning.  \n",
    "- **factoids_creation**: Contains functions to generate factoids, which are small structured pieces of information extracted from sources.  \n",
    "- **resource_rooting**: Manages the rooting or linking of resources, possibly resolving references and establishing connections between entities.  \n",
    "- **evolution_construction**: Deals with constructing or evolving entities and data models over time, including temporal versioning.  \n",
    "- **fact_graph_construction**: Constructs the final knowledge graph by combining all processed data, factoids, and relationships.\n",

    "   - `IoU` (Intersection over Union) → fraction of street numbers with the correct number of versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sources Metric**  \n",
    "   - Measures whether the **sources associated with each version** match the reference, ignoring a specified fragmentary source label.  \n",
    "   - For each SN:\n",
    "     - `true` → all versions have matching sources.  \n",

    "The first evaluation aims to verify whether the insertion of fragmentary\n",
    "states and events alters the composition of geometry attribute versions.\n",
    "More precisely, we check whether versions resulting from the merging of\n",

    "  is observed, with only a limited number of modified versions.\n",

    "modifies the temporal localisation of attribute changes.\n",

    "The objective is to ensure that detected change instants remain consistent\n",
